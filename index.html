                        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                        amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                        found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                        weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since

                        "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
                        needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                        The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                        hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
                        next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
                        often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
                        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
                        developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
